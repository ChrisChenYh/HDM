### TODO List
- [x] Hugging face and Gradio demo.
- [ ] Google Colab demo.
- [ ] Training and inference. 
- [ ] Evaluation code. 

## Dependencies
The code is tested on `torch=1.12.1+cu113, cuda11.3, debian11`. We recommend using anaconda environment:
```shell
conda create -n hdm python=3.8
conda activate hdm 
```
Required packages can be installed by:
```shell
pip install -r pre-requirements.txt # Install pytorch and others
pip install -r requirements.txt     # Install pytorch3d from source
```
In case pytorch3d compilation failed, you can tried to install prebuilt wheels. In this case, pytorch should also be reinstalled. 
The following combination of torch and pytorch3d has been tested to be compatible:
```shell
pip install torch==1.11.0+cu113 torchvision==0.12.0+cu113 torchaudio==0.11.0 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113
pip install --no-index --no-cache-dir pytorch3d -f https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/pytorch3d/packaging/wheels/py38_cu113_pyt1110/download.html
```

## Run demo
**Hugging face demo:** <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/xiexh20/HDM-interaction-recon"  style='padding-left: 0.5rem;'><img src='https://img.shields.io/badge/%F0%9F%A4%97%20Hugging%20Face-Spaces-orange'></a><br></br>
**Google Colab:** coming soon.

**Gradio demo on your own machine**:

Simply run with:  
```shell
python app.py
```
In case of a headless remote server, you can run `python app.py run.share=True` to create a temporal public url which you can access the webpage in laptop browser. 

**Command line demo**:

Alternatively, you can run the demo given image path:
```shell
python demo.py run.image_path=<RGB image path> dataset.std_coverage=<optional, a value between 3.0 and 3.8> 
```
For example: `python demo.py run.image_path=$PWD/examples/017450/k1.color.jpg dataset.std_coverage=3.0`

## Training
#### Download data
We mainly train our model on synthetic ProciGen dataset and test on real BEHAVE data. You can download them here:  [ProciGen](https://edmond.mpg.de/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.17617/3.2VUEUS), [BEHAVE](https://virtualhumans.mpi-inf.mpg.de/behave/).

Once downloaded, modify `behave_dir` and `procigen_dir` in `configs/structured.py` to your local path.  

#### Pre-process data
We provide a split file including all images from ProciGen and test images from BEHAVE, [download here](https://edmond.mpg.de/file.xhtml?fileId=247856&version=2.1). 

To train stage 1 segmentation model, you will need to precompute the occupancy of human and object. We provide processed data for ProciGen [here](https://edmond.mpg.de/file.xhtml?fileId=247856&version=2.1). Download and unzip the file. 
Then you can run `python scripts/process_occ.py -o <unzipped occ files> -p <ProciGen path>` to process the downloaded occupancy file. 

Alternatively, you can process the sequence using: `python scripts/compute_occ.py -s <path to one sequence>`.

#### Train 
We train our stage 1 and stage 2 models separately in parallel to reduce training time. You can find example commands in `scripts/train.sh`. The checkpoint and logs will be saved to `outputs`. 


## Evaluation
#### Pre-trained checkpoints
We provide checkpoints for models trained only on synthetic ProciGen, download them from [here](https://datasets.d2.mpi-inf.mpg.de/cvpr24procigen/pretrained.zip).

#### Run inference on BEHAVE test set
We provide example command to run batch inference at `scripts/test.sh`. Similar to training, the two stages are also run separately to reduce runtime.  

#### Evaluate results 
After inference is done, results can be evaluated with: 
```shell
python eval/eval_separate.py -pr outputs/stage2/single/<save_name>/pred -gt outputs/stage2/single/<save_name>/gt -split configs/splits/behave-test.json 
```
The numbers will be saved to `./results`.
